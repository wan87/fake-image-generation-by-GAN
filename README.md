# MNIST Fake Image Generation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate fake images for the MNIST dataset. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through adversarial training. The generator tries to create realistic images, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake images.
